# Prometheus Replica Operator

A Kubernetes Operator for Prometheus + Thanos, built on top of the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/coreos/operator-sdk).

[This blog post shows how I built](https://robszumski.com/building-an-operator/) the Prometheus Replica Operator, which is the first complex Go program I’ve written. While the Go code itself may not be the best example of software engineering, I wanted to try out my team’s Operator SDK. As the Product Manager for the Operator SDK, I want to have first hand knowledge of our tool. As an early employee of CoreOS, I do have a lot of knowledge about Operators, and I want to pass on some best practices through the post.

## What the PRO does

The PRO will install and configure a full monitoring stack on a Kubernetes cluster, using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for ingesting, storing and querying the time series data. Archival data is automatically sent to a cloud storage bucket with [Thanos](https://github.com/improbable-eng/thanos).

## Example

The Operator watches for `PrometheusReplica` objects, such as this one:

```
apiVersion: "prometheus.robszumski.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "PrometheusReplica"
metadata:
  name: "example"
spec:
  configMap: prometheus-config
  highlyAvailable: true
  baseDomain: "ingress.example.com"
  metrics:
    retention: 24h
    blockDuration: 1h
  bucketSecret: s3-bucket
```
  
And configures the entire monitoring stack:

## Install

First, install the CRD:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robszumski/prometheus-replica-operator/master/deploy/crd.yaml
```

Then run the Operator:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robszumski/prometheus-replica-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml
```

Last, create the `PrometheusReplica` object:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robszumski/prometheus-replica-operator/master/deploy/cr.yaml
```

If everything worked correctly, you should see the Pods, Services, Deployments and StatefulSets created. The status of the `PrometheusReplica` should also have this information:

```
$ kubectl -n default get prometheusreplica/example -o yaml
```
